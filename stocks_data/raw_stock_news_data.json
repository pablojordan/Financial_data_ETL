the $600bn reinsurance industry\u2019s top brass prepare to gather for their annual shindig in Monte Carlo this weekend, they have one eye on the path of Hurricane Dorian up the eastern coast of the US.  The lack of large insurance losses this year has been a boon for the industry, but payouts could rise sharply if the biggest storm of this year\u2019s hurricane season makes landfall in the US.  The prices that the likes of Swiss Re, Munich Re and Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway can charge their customers had been falling for years as the era of low interest rates drove money \u2014 and hence fresh capacity \u2014 into the industry.","1":"Stephanie Link said on CNBC's \"Fast Money Halftime Report\" that American International Group Inc (NYSE: AIG) had a good quarter, but the stock is trading lower because of the macro environment.  Jim Lebenthal would be comfortable to add to a long position in Marathon Petroleum Corp (NYSE: MPC).  The company is also buying back shares and Lebenthal thinks Marathon Petroleum is a great stock to buy both on fundamentals and valuation.","2":"American International Group, Inc. (AIG) today announced it has appointed Duncan Ellis as Head of Retail Property, North America General Insurance.  Mr. Ellis will lead General Insurance\u2019s North American Retail Property business and focus on diversifying the company\u2019s Property portfolio and implementing consistent underwriting practices in the U.S., Bermuda and Canada that are aligned with AIG\u2019s overall risk appetite.","3":"Allstate's (ALL) well-performing Property and Casualty segment and growing Service business poise it well for growth.","4":"After writing about American International Group  earlier today, I thought about looking at the charts of Everest Re Group, Ltd.  , and I found a similar weak pattern on their charts.  In this daily bar chart of RE, below, we can see that prices have rolled over since early May.

It's the No. 3 auto insurer in the country and has a foothold in the home insurance market.Source: Shutterstock What many don't realize is PGR has been in the insurance business since 1965 and is one of the most consistent leaders in incorporating new technology into the property & casualty (P&C) sector.Up until recently, insurers were enjoying an ideal market. Slow, steady growth and low interest rates meant consumers were comfortable, and looking to upgrade cars, houses, jet skis, motorcycles, and the like.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Cheap Dividend Stocks to Load Up On And the strong dollar was very helpful since Progressive, like all insurers, has to keep a chunk of the cash it gets from premiums in cash or cash alternatives like U.S. Treasury bonds so it can pay out any potential losses.The rest of cash it can invest to help boost its returns. Insuring more things that are newer means more premium growth, which means more money to invest.When you have falling rates on Treasuries, you have rising prices, which means PGR is making money on its cash equivalents. And when the stock market is strong, it means PGR is making money on its investments.In Q2, which was reported in mid-July, PGR's net investment income was up 43% compared to the same quarter last year. Its unrealized equity gains were up $505 million, compared to a $102 million loss last year.The auto insurance line grew premiums 15% year over year, and including all lines, business was up 12%. This includes losses from the Midwest floods and the fires out West.There was also a recent report from the Swiss Re Institute that insured losses in the first half of 2019 were down 30%. That is a great environment for a P&C insurer and PGR stock. It means that much more of its money can be earning instead of being paid out on claims. Company Expansion Will Help PGR StockMoving forward, which is what Progressive does relentlessly, judging by its Q2 investor presentation, the company is looking to expand its commercial vehicle and property insurance sector.This is a huge and expanding market where PGR has some exposure, but it seems it's looking to make significant inroads, given the fact that its entire Q2 presentation was about the market and the opportunities within the market.This sector covers everything from fleet vehicles to contractor programs (heavy duty machinery and equipment), to for-hire transportation (contracted tractor trailers and drivers) as well as everything in between. It even includes Uber (UBER) drivers.The point is, Progressive is already taking advantage of the evolving gig economy within its product lines.PGR stock is up 20% in the past year and 29% year to date. And because it's a U.S.-focused company, international issues aren't significant for PGR. That's why my Portfolio Grader gives PGR stock an A and continues to rate is as a strong buy.

Last week, President Trump was lobbing vitriol at the Chinese via Twitter (NASDAQ:TWTR) and opining that his only regret was not hitting the world's second-largest economy with higher tariffs.Source: Pavel Ignatov \/ Shutterstock.com Today, Trump, from the G7 summit in France, said China is anxious to make a deal. While the Chinese are urging dialogue between the two sides, media outlets there implied that policymakers' desire to come together with the U.S. on trade isn't as Trump is leading the world to believe.\"They want to make a deal very badly,\" said Trump in France. \"The tariffs have hit them very hard.\"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOver the weekend, Trump announced a trade deal with Japan, the finishing touches on which still need to be applied, but it looks like that country will up its purchases of U.S. agriculture goods while Trump is pledging to relax some tariffs on Japanese exports.Overall, the improved trade sentiment was enough to send the Nasdaq Composite higher by 1.32% while the S&P 500 soared by 1.11%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average started the week in style, adding 1.05%. In late trading, just four Dow stocks were lower, but it's worth nothing two if not three of those names are tariff-sensitive fare. Marvelous MickeyWalt Disney (NYSE:DIS) was the best-performing member of the Dow today, climbing 2.94%. Some of this may be enthusiasm for the company saying that it's opening 25 stores in Target (NYSE:TGT) locations around the country in early October, just in time for the holiday shopping season.\"Disney stores will launch inside Target in major cities such as Philadelphia, Denver and Chicago. The company has stand-alone stores, but has closed its locations in West Virginia and Florida this year,\" according to Reuters.I'll go out on a limb here and say that perhaps some of the rally in Disney shares today is attributable to the start of college football season and the looming kickoff of the NFL, two butters for the bread of Disney unit ESPN. An Apple TodayI frequently say here that investors shouldn't get caught up in one day of market action, so I won't go out on a limb and say that growth stocks are back, but it was encouraging to see Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) finish higher by 1.90% today. This is most certainly a trade war story because Apple counts on China for 20% of its revenue. Fortunately, President Trump cooperated for one day at least, prompting some bullish musings from Apple analysts.\"We see certain silver lining relative to timing that might allow Apple to navigate the challenging dynamic better than investors currently expect,\" J.P. Morgan analyst Samik Chatterjee wrote in a research note Monday, according to Barron's. Interesting AsidesOn a happier note, it was nice to Travelers (NYSE:TRV), probably the most overlooked Dow financial stock, rise 1.80% today even though this company has essentially no China exposure.Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) stock has been anything but healthy this month or this year, but managed to gain 1.02% today. An Oklahoma judge is expected to rule later on JNJ's fate in the controversial opioid case. No, the company isn't going bankrupt over this, but it's likely looking at some hefty legal bills. Dow Jones Bottom LineHopefully, the White House looks at Monday's market action and sees it as a sign that when civility reigns in trade talks with China, investors benefit. Beijing should realize the same because it's not as if markets there have been immune to the trade volatility. Far from it -- at a time when the major market catalysts are President Trump's Twitter account and the Federal Reserve, investors are left hoping that the former relaxes, even a little bit.Todd Shriber does not own any of the aforementioned securities.
