A number of initiatives undertaken by the company to improve profitability in the auto segment have helped it to achieve growth. A strong balance sheet and intelligent capital management are other positives. The acquisition of SquareTrade, PlumChoice and InfoArmor will provide diversification benefits.</p>\\n<p style=\\\"text-align:justify;\\\">The Zacks Ranked #2 (Buy) stock has witnessed 1.2% upward revision in 2019 earnings estimates over the past seven days. The stock carries an impressive Value Score of A. Our research shows that stocks with a Value Style Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1(Strong Buy) or 2 offer the best opportunities in the value investing space.You can see <strong>the complete list of today\\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here</strong><strong>.</strong></p>\\n<p style=\\\"text-align:justify;\\\">Year to date, the stock has gained 24% compared with the industry\\u2019s growth of 3.4%. Other players in the same industry such as American International Group, Inc. AIG, The Progressive Corp. PGR and Chubb Limited CB have gained 32%, 26% and 21%, respectively.</p>\\n<p style=\\\"text-align:justify;\\\"><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/F2Hy9u7pnfcedf.nqMZ_4Q--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247cT03NTs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/zacks.com/025e21e8c5dbf24012cded2379768639\\\" style=\\\"width:620px;height:214px;\\\" /></p>\\n<p style=\\\"text-align:justify;\\\"><strong>Factors That Make the Stock Look Attractive</strong></p>\\n<p style=\\\"text-align:justify;\\\"><strong>Property-Liability Business Performing Strongly:</strong> The company's property and liability business continues to be profitable owing to pricing discipline and strong claims management. It is also benefiting from past acquisitions and growth in the emerging businesses as reflected by consistent increase in earned written over the years. The trend continued in the first six months of 2019, reflecting a 6% increase in net written. We expect the segment to continue adding to its top line, given a number of strategic initiatives undertaken for growth, such as product enhancements and changes in business mix to focus on those that command a high return on equity.<br><br>Also, its combined ratio, which measures the profitability of an insurance company, (the lower the better) has improved to 93.6% in 2019 from 96% in 2018. This reflects the company\\u2019s control on its claims cost as well as other expenses. Though Allstate is exposed to catastrophic losses, it has covered itself well by the use of reinsurance to&nbsp; deal with these losses.</br></br></p>\\n<p style=\\\"text-align:justify;\\\"><strong>Growing Service Business:&nbsp; </strong>The company is making concerted efforts to expand its Service business, which provides diversification benefits. In this vein, it acquired SquareTrade in 2017, a provider of protection plans for mobile phones, consumer electronics and appliances. Allstate also acquired PlumChoice in 2018, a leading provider of cloud and technical support services to consumers and small businesses. In February 2019, iCracked was acquired in this segment,&nbsp; These buyouts will expand its Service business, which grew premiums by 6.5% in the first half of 2019.<br>Decline in Leverage: The company\\u2019s debt-to-equity ratio has moderated to 27% from 30% in 2013. Times interest earned of Allstate, a ratio that measures a company\\u2019s ability to pay its interest expenses is 11, better than the industry average of 10.7. A decline in leverage strengthens the company\\u2019s balance sheet and reduces financial risk.</br></p>\\n<p style=\\\"text-align:justify;\\\"><strong>Strong Balance Sheet and Efficient Capital Management:</strong> The company\\u2019s cash flow has been increasing over the years. Management\\u2019s proactive risk mitigation and return optimization programs continue to enhance operating cash flow and shareholder value. Its disciplined capital management by way of share buyback and dividend hike is also impressive.&nbsp; In February, Allstate increased its quarterly dividend by 24%. Its current dividend yield of 2.2% is considerably higher than 0.53% of the industry. We believe, the company\\u2019s financial strength will continue to inspire investors\\u2019 confidence in the stock.</p>\\n<p style=\\\"text-align:justify;\\\"><strong>Strong ROE: </strong>Allstate\\u2019s trailing 12-month return on equity (ROE) reinforces its growth potential. The company\\u2019s ROE of 13% has improved over the past two years and remains way higher than the industry\\u2019s 6.8% ROE, reflecting its tactical efficiency in using its shareholders\\u2019 funds.</p>\\n<p style=\\\"text-align:justify;\\\"><strong>The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All</strong><br><br>Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce \\\"the world's first trillionaires,\\\" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.<br><br><strong>See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend &gt;&gt;</strong></br></br></br></br></p>\\n<br>Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Its performance aroused scepticism over its ability to turn around the underperforming business.</p>\\n<p style=\\\"text-align:justify;\\\">This pessimism also led to a 34% decline in the company\\u2019s share price in 2018 and 8.8% fall in 2017. However, in 2019, the stock has gained 33% year to date compared with its industry\\u2019s rise of 0.5%.</p>\\n<p style=\\\"text-align:justify;\\\"><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"https://s1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/LWEsQ1Ix9VAy7YMkYWGF2A--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247cT03NTs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/zacks.com/0e16263f7828daa4349c7550ee5a5490\\\" /></p>\\n<p style=\\\"text-align:justify;\\\">Since the beginning of 2018, American International has been focusing on addressing several critical areas, such as refining its approach to underwriting, reducing risk profile, overhauling reinsurance strategy to reduce volatility, making General Insurance business profitable and remediating challenged legacy businesses, and position itself strategically in the global insurance marketplace.</p>\\n<p style=\\\"text-align:justify;\\\">The company has achieved quite a bit in its largest segment, General Insurance (contributing nearly 67% of total revenues in 2018), by posting an underwriting profit and a favorable combined ratio in the first half of 2019. This underwriting profit represents a significant milestone for AIG, and reflects the tremendous work taken up by management to improve underwriting fundamentals.</p>\\n<p style=\\\"text-align:justify;\\\">The company\\u2019s approach to reinsurance, which has dramatically reduced risk and volatility, onboard acquisitions and continuous expense discipline across General Insurance, is expected to drive the segment\\u2019s results. Management remains confident that the segment will continue to improve its financial performance and deliver underwriting profit for full-year 2019.</p>\\n<p style=\\\"text-align:justify;\\\">Along with growing its top line, the company has tightened its grip on expenses, which has aided its margins. It has also witnessed a decline in expense ratio, despite making investments in talent, business process and infrastructure to support its long-term profitable growth objectives.</p>\\n<p style=\\\"text-align:justify;\\\">AIG\\u2019s continuous focus on strengthening its underwriting fundamentals, the changing mix of business and the focus on inorganic growth should pay off. Recently the company completed the buyout of Validus and Glatfelter. Validus adds an attractive bundle of businesses, including a reinsurance platform (Validus Re), an insurance-linked securities asset manager (AlphaCat), a Lloyd\\u2019s syndicate (Talbot), a specialty US small commercial excess and surplus underwriting team (Western World), and Crop Risk services, which focuses on the North American crop insurance market.</p>\\n<p style=\\\"text-align:justify;\\\">The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).&nbsp; Some better-ranked stocks worth considering are James River Group Holdings, Ltd. JRVR, Assurant Inc. AIZ and Radian Group, Inc. RDN. While James River Group sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Assurant and Radian Group carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).<br><br>James River beat estimates in three of the four reported quarters with an average positive surprise of 2.62%. Assurant and Radian beat estimates in each of the four reported quarters with an average positive surprise of 21.75% and 10.10%, respectively.</br></br></p>\\n<p>You can see <strong>the complete list of today\\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here</strong><strong>.</strong></p>\\n<p style=\\\"text-align:justify;\\\"><br><strong>Today's Best Stocks from Zacks</strong><br><br>Would you like to see the updated picks from our best market-beating strategies?

      "                    \"content\": \"<p>By Suzanne Barlyn</p> \\n<p>NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bruce Gendelman wanted a mountainside retreat when he bought 12 acres in Aspen, Colorado. But forest fires that have torched nearby land in recent years left him concerned.</p> \\n<p>So Gendelman, who runs an insurance brokerage, tapped into a program that American International Group Inc offers to help design luxury properties in ways that mitigate disaster risk. A risk specialist made sure his home had a lightning-repellant system, cisterns to hold water run-off and ceramic shingles that look like wood. Just in case a blaze does break out, his driveway was designed to accommodate a fire truck's maneuvers.</p> \\n<p>\\\"It's a very high-end home and we're dealing with very good contractors,\\\" Gendelman said. \\\"But (the AIG program) brought them systems they never used and resources they never heard of.\\\"</p> \\n<p>Fires, floods, hurricanes and other catastrophes have cost https://tmsnrt.rs/2Zq5hUs U.S. insurers more than $170 billion in property losses since 2016, according to Property Claim Services (PCS), part of Verisk Analytics Inc, and the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis.</p> \\n<p>Few actuaries expect the trend to ease as climate change accelerates, and the swell of claims has prompted some insurers to get involved in the design process for lavish residential properties.</p> \\n<p>Insurers and industry groups said they do not track data on the service, which is still a tiny part of the property-casualty insurance industry. But executives, real-estate developers and brokers, builders and analysts who spoke to Reuters said they believe it will only expand.</p> \\n<p>\\\"People don't naturally think of insurance as the first place to go,\\\" said Jennifer Naughton, head of North American personal insurance risk consulting services at Chubb Ltd. \\\"But an insurance company can give you an advantage of the loss potential and might save you the pain of loss in the future.\\\"</p> \\n<p>Chubb's risk managers make sure homeowners who request the service have water storage on the property to supplement the local fire department's resources, and recommend devices that allow emergency workers to open electronic entry gates, among other measures.</p> \\n<p>The trend is not entirely new: PURE Insurance has offered the service since its founding in 2007, and others have quietly made risk specialists available to customers who are designing a home and know to ask for the service. But it is now picking up steam as a stand-alone business at some major property-casualty insurers, as more clients worry about extreme weather.</p> \\n<p>AIG started marketing its service as \\\"Smart Build\\\" in 2015. Initially, only residential construction projects that cost more than $5 million were eligible, but AIG lowered the threshold to $1 million two years later.</p> \\n<p>AIG would not say how many homes it has helped design in total, but a spokesman said there were 20% more projects enrolled during the first six months of 2019 than in the prior-year period.</p> \\n<p>Cincinnati Insurance Companies joined the fray more recently, as did Vault, a high net-worth insurer launched in 2017 by a group of former AIG executives. W.R. Berkley Corp is also looking to offer the service as it ramps up business with wealthy clientele.</p> \\n<p> </p>\\n<p>(GRAPHIC on property losses due to U.S. disasters link: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/INSURERS-DISASTERS/0H001QERS818/index.html)</p> \\n<p> </p>\\n<p>FINE ART PROTECTION</p> \\n<p>The home design process typically begins with an insurance risk specialist scoping out a site to assess possible dangers. For instance, if there is a high water table underground or a nearby body of water, they may suggest elevating the home or choosing another place to build to avoid the risk of flooding.</p> \\n<p>Ken Vona, who heads KVC Builders LLC and frequently teams up with PURE, recalled a couple who decided against a location because the house would have to be raised some 18 feet (5.5 m)off the ground to guard against flood risk. </p> \\n<p>\\\"A perfect example of 'bad piece of property, nice view,'\\\" he said.</p> \\n<p>Once a site is selected, specialists review architectural plans, making sure designs are resistant to water and fire damage, among other risks. They scrutinize plumbing layouts, help design hurricane-proof storage rooms to protect valuables, vet the adequacy of sprinkler systems, measure driveway entrances and make sure there is a hydrant nearby.</p> \\n<p>Cameron Strothman, a senior risk manager for AIG Private Client Group, said he once had to figure out how to protect a site that was four miles away from the nearest hydrant. He liaised with the local fire department and advised the client to install a 30,000-gallon tank under the driveway so that fire trucks could tap a private water source instead. It cost $35,000.</p> \\n<p>Risk specialists' suggestions generally represent 10 to 15% of total building costs, insurance experts said.</p> \\n<p>Some of the features are things homebuilders would likely install anyway, like a sophisticated fire alarm or sprinkler system, or measures required by building codes. Others cost very little money but can prevent extremely expensive damage. For instance, there is a $100 sensor that shuts off water systems after detecting a leak.</p> \\n<p>Adding these features at the time of construction is also cheaper than doing so once the home is built, risk experts said. A protective storage room for fine art may run less than $100,000 if designed into the plans compared to millions of dollars later, said Steve Bitterman, Vault's chief risk services officer.</p> \\n<p>Gendelman would not disclose the costs associated with building or protecting his home, but said AIG did not charge him for the advice.</p> \\n<p>\\\"Providing this service free is smart for everyone,\\\" he said. \\\"They help me with ideas and they get a loyal client.\\\"</p> \\n<p> </p>\\n<p> (Reporting by Suzanne Barlyn, Editing by Rosalba O'Brien)</p>\",\n",

That brings the total funding to date to more than $100 million.</p>\\n<p>Speaking to&nbsp;<a href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/show/theticker/\\\">Yahoo Finance\\u2019s The Ticker</a>, CEO and Co-Founder Peter Colis said the company would use the fresh funding to expand its team and build on its momentum.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe think of Ethos as what Northwestern Mutual has done for the past 100 years, Ethos is going to do for the next 150 years, protecting generations and generations of families to come,\\u201d Colis said.</p>\\n<p>Founded in 2016, Ethos has utilized artificial intelligence technology to overhaul the life insurance model, built by established players like AIG (<a href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AIG?p=AIG&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch\\\">AIG</a>) and Mass Mutual Financial. Colis says the insurance application process takes on average 15 weeks, in part because of required medical exams and lengthy paperwork.</p>\\n<p>Ethos uses big data and predictive analytics to determine an individual\\u2019s life expectancy and streamline the process. Colis says that allows Ethos to issue insurance on the spot, improving access in the process.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cEthos lets you buy it while you\\u2019re in line at Starbucks. It\\u2019s a 10 minute application and you\\u2019re done,\\u201d Colis said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s an underpenetrated product that should be a household financial product.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Colis says costs associated with the application process have only added to the coverage gap. While 70% of Americans consider life insurance a necessity, 41% have no coverage, according to&nbsp;<a href=\\\"http://theasagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2017-Insurance-Barometer_FINAL.pdf\\\">industry figures</a>.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s a structural issue where you have commissioned sales agents who are incentivized to sell you the largest most expensive policy to the family that can afford that expensive policy. So they\\u2019ll usually try to sell you an investment feature policy that isn\\u2019t necessarily right given your need, your ability to pay,\\u201d Colis said.</p>\\n<p>Ethos\\u2019s coverage is limited to term life insurance right now, which covers individuals for a set time period instead of their entire life. Its revenue has quadrupled since October 2018, according to a company statement.</p>\\n<p>The San Francisco-based firm is one of a handful of startups that are using technology to shake up the insurance space globally. Last year alone, VCs poured more than $3 billion into insurtech companies, according to data compiled by the Fintech Global Database.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/splash/allmarketssummit\\\"> <img src=\\\"https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-08/4bc028c0-c4b5-11e9-8fe7-e809749ffc2e\\\" alt=\\\"Sign up!\\\" credit=\\\"Yahoo Finance\\\" crediturl=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"720\\\" height=\\\"177\\\" data-ops=\\\"\\\"> </img></a></p>\\n<p>-</p>\\n<p><em>Akiko Fujita is an anchor and reporter for Yahoo Finance.

A number of initiatives undertaken by the company to improve profitability in the auto segment have helped it to achieve growth. A strong balance sheet and intelligent capital management are other positives. The acquisition of SquareTrade, PlumChoice and InfoArmor will provide diversification benefits.</p>\\n<p style=\\\"text-align:justify;\\\">The Zacks Ranked #2 (Buy) stock has witnessed 1.2% upward revision in 2019 earnings estimates over the past seven days. The stock carries an impressive Value Score of A. Our research shows that stocks with a Value Style Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1(Strong Buy) or 2 offer the best opportunities in the value investing space.You can see <strong>the complete list of today\\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here</strong><strong>.</strong></p>\\n<p style=\\\"text-align:justify;\\\">Year to date, the stock has gained 24% compared with the industry\\u2019s growth of 3.4%. Other players in the same industry such as American International Group, Inc. AIG, The Progressive Corp. PGR and Chubb Limited CB have gained 32%, 26% and 21%, respectively.</p>\\n<p style=\\\"text-align:justify;\\\"><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/F2Hy9u7pnfcedf.nqMZ_4Q--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247cT03NTs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/zacks.com/025e21e8c5dbf24012cded2379768639\\\" style=\\\"width:620px;height:214px;\\\" /></p>\\n<p style=\\\"text-align:justify;\\\"><strong>Factors That Make the Stock Look Attractive</strong></p>\\n<p style=\\\"text-align:justify;\\\"><strong>Property-Liability Business Performing Strongly:</strong> The company's property and liability business continues to be profitable owing to pricing discipline and strong claims management. It is also benefiting from past acquisitions and growth in the emerging businesses as reflected by consistent increase in earned written over the years. The trend continued in the first six months of 2019, reflecting a 6% increase in net written. We expect the segment to continue adding to its top line, given a number of strategic initiatives undertaken for growth, such as product enhancements and changes in business mix to focus on those that command a high return on equity.<br><br>Also, its combined ratio, which measures the profitability of an insurance company, (the lower the better) has improved to 93.6% in 2019 from 96% in 2018. This reflects the company\\u2019s control on its claims cost as well as other expenses. Though Allstate is exposed to catastrophic losses, it has covered itself well by the use of reinsurance to&nbsp; deal with these losses.</br></br></p>\\n<p style=\\\"text-align:justify;\\\"><strong>Growing Service Business:&nbsp; </strong>The company is making concerted efforts to expand its Service business, which provides diversification benefits. In this vein, it acquired SquareTrade in 2017, a provider of protection plans for mobile phones, consumer electronics and appliances. Allstate also acquired PlumChoice in 2018, a leading provider of cloud and technical support services to consumers and small businesses. In February 2019, iCracked was acquired in this segment,&nbsp; These buyouts will expand its Service business, which grew premiums by 6.5% in the first half of 2019.<br>Decline in Leverage: The company\\u2019s debt-to-equity ratio has moderated to 27% from 30% in 2013. Times interest earned of Allstate, a ratio that measures a company\\u2019s ability to pay its interest expenses is 11, better than the industry average of 10.7. A decline in leverage strengthens the company\\u2019s balance sheet and reduces financial risk.</br></p>\\n<p style=\\\"text-align:justify;\\\"><strong>Strong Balance Sheet and Efficient Capital Management:</strong> The company\\u2019s cash flow has been increasing over the years. Management\\u2019s proactive risk mitigation and return optimization programs continue to enhance operating cash flow and shareholder value. Its disciplined capital management by way of share buyback and dividend hike is also impressive.&nbsp; In February, Allstate increased its quarterly dividend by 24%. Its current dividend yield of 2.2% is considerably higher than 0.53% of the industry. We believe, the company\\u2019s financial strength will continue to inspire investors\\u2019 confidence in the stock.</p>\\n<p style=\\\"text-align:justify;\\\"><strong>Strong ROE: </strong>Allstate\\u2019s trailing 12-month return on equity (ROE) reinforces its growth potential. The company\\u2019s ROE of 13% has improved over the past two years and remains way higher than the industry\\u2019s 6.8% ROE, reflecting its tactical efficiency in using its shareholders\\u2019 funds.</p>\\n<p style=\\\"text-align:justify;\\\"><strong>The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All</strong><br><br>Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce \\\"the world's first trillionaires,\\\" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.<br><br><strong>See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend &gt;&gt;</strong></br></br></br></br></p>\\n<br>Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Its performance aroused scepticism over its ability to turn around the underperforming business.</p>\\n<p style=\\\"text-align:justify;\\\">This pessimism also led to a 34% decline in the company\\u2019s share price in 2018 and 8.8% fall in 2017. However, in 2019, the stock has gained 33% year to date compared with its industry\\u2019s rise of 0.5%.</p>\\n<p style=\\\"text-align:justify;\\\"><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"https://s1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/LWEsQ1Ix9VAy7YMkYWGF2A--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247cT03NTs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/zacks.com/0e16263f7828daa4349c7550ee5a5490\\\" /></p>\\n<p style=\\\"text-align:justify;\\\">Since the beginning of 2018, American International has been focusing on addressing several critical areas, such as refining its approach to underwriting, reducing risk profile, overhauling reinsurance strategy to reduce volatility, making General Insurance business profitable and remediating challenged legacy businesses, and position itself strategically in the global insurance marketplace.</p>\\n<p style=\\\"text-align:justify;\\\">The company has achieved quite a bit in its largest segment, General Insurance (contributing nearly 67% of total revenues in 2018), by posting an underwriting profit and a favorable combined ratio in the first half of 2019. This underwriting profit represents a significant milestone for AIG, and reflects the tremendous work taken up by management to improve underwriting fundamentals.</p>\\n<p style=\\\"text-align:justify;\\\">The company\\u2019s approach to reinsurance, which has dramatically reduced risk and volatility, onboard acquisitions and continuous expense discipline across General Insurance, is expected to drive the segment\\u2019s results. Management remains confident that the segment will continue to improve its financial performance and deliver underwriting profit for full-year 2019.</p>\\n<p style=\\\"text-align:justify;\\\">Along with growing its top line, the company has tightened its grip on expenses, which has aided its margins. It has also witnessed a decline in expense ratio, despite making investments in talent, business process and infrastructure to support its long-term profitable growth objectives.</p>\\n<p style=\\\"text-align:justify;\\\">AIG\\u2019s continuous focus on strengthening its underwriting fundamentals, the changing mix of business and the focus on inorganic growth should pay off. Recently the company completed the buyout of Validus and Glatfelter. Validus adds an attractive bundle of businesses, including a reinsurance platform (Validus Re), an insurance-linked securities asset manager (AlphaCat), a Lloyd\\u2019s syndicate (Talbot), a specialty US small commercial excess and surplus underwriting team (Western World), and Crop Risk services, which focuses on the North American crop insurance market.</p>\\n<p style=\\\"text-align:justify;\\\">The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).&nbsp; Some better-ranked stocks worth considering are James River Group Holdings, Ltd. JRVR, Assurant Inc. AIZ and Radian Group, Inc. RDN. While James River Group sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Assurant and Radian Group carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).<br><br>James River beat estimates in three of the four reported quarters with an average positive surprise of 2.62%. Assurant and Radian beat estimates in each of the four reported quarters with an average positive surprise of 21.75% and 10.10%, respectively.</br></br></p>\\n<p>You can see <strong>the complete list of today\\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here</strong><strong>.</strong></p>\\n<p style=\\\"text-align:justify;\\\"><br><strong>Today's Best Stocks from Zacks</strong><br><br>Would you like to see the updated picks from our best market-beating strategies?

      "                    \"content\": \"<p>By Suzanne Barlyn</p> \\n<p>NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bruce Gendelman wanted a mountainside retreat when he bought 12 acres in Aspen, Colorado. But forest fires that have torched nearby land in recent years left him concerned.</p> \\n<p>So Gendelman, who runs an insurance brokerage, tapped into a program that American International Group Inc offers to help design luxury properties in ways that mitigate disaster risk. A risk specialist made sure his home had a lightning-repellant system, cisterns to hold water run-off and ceramic shingles that look like wood. Just in case a blaze does break out, his driveway was designed to accommodate a fire truck's maneuvers.</p> \\n<p>\\\"It's a very high-end home and we're dealing with very good contractors,\\\" Gendelman said. \\\"But (the AIG program) brought them systems they never used and resources they never heard of.\\\"</p> \\n<p>Fires, floods, hurricanes and other catastrophes have cost https://tmsnrt.rs/2Zq5hUs U.S. insurers more than $170 billion in property losses since 2016, according to Property Claim Services (PCS), part of Verisk Analytics Inc, and the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis.</p> \\n<p>Few actuaries expect the trend to ease as climate change accelerates, and the swell of claims has prompted some insurers to get involved in the design process for lavish residential properties.</p> \\n<p>Insurers and industry groups said they do not track data on the service, which is still a tiny part of the property-casualty insurance industry. But executives, real-estate developers and brokers, builders and analysts who spoke to Reuters said they believe it will only expand.</p> \\n<p>\\\"People don't naturally think of insurance as the first place to go,\\\" said Jennifer Naughton, head of North American personal insurance risk consulting services at Chubb Ltd. \\\"But an insurance company can give you an advantage of the loss potential and might save you the pain of loss in the future.\\\"</p> \\n<p>Chubb's risk managers make sure homeowners who request the service have water storage on the property to supplement the local fire department's resources, and recommend devices that allow emergency workers to open electronic entry gates, among other measures.</p> \\n<p>The trend is not entirely new: PURE Insurance has offered the service since its founding in 2007, and others have quietly made risk specialists available to customers who are designing a home and know to ask for the service. But it is now picking up steam as a stand-alone business at some major property-casualty insurers, as more clients worry about extreme weather.</p> \\n<p>AIG started marketing its service as \\\"Smart Build\\\" in 2015. Initially, only residential construction projects that cost more than $5 million were eligible, but AIG lowered the threshold to $1 million two years later.</p> \\n<p>AIG would not say how many homes it has helped design in total, but a spokesman said there were 20% more projects enrolled during the first six months of 2019 than in the prior-year period.</p> \\n<p>Cincinnati Insurance Companies joined the fray more recently, as did Vault, a high net-worth insurer launched in 2017 by a group of former AIG executives. W.R. Berkley Corp is also looking to offer the service as it ramps up business with wealthy clientele.</p> \\n<p> </p>\\n<p>(GRAPHIC on property losses due to U.S. disasters link: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/INSURERS-DISASTERS/0H001QERS818/index.html)</p> \\n<p> </p>\\n<p>FINE ART PROTECTION</p> \\n<p>The home design process typically begins with an insurance risk specialist scoping out a site to assess possible dangers. For instance, if there is a high water table underground or a nearby body of water, they may suggest elevating the home or choosing another place to build to avoid the risk of flooding.</p> \\n<p>Ken Vona, who heads KVC Builders LLC and frequently teams up with PURE, recalled a couple who decided against a location because the house would have to be raised some 18 feet (5.5 m)off the ground to guard against flood risk. </p> \\n<p>\\\"A perfect example of 'bad piece of property, nice view,'\\\" he said.</p> \\n<p>Once a site is selected, specialists review architectural plans, making sure designs are resistant to water and fire damage, among other risks. They scrutinize plumbing layouts, help design hurricane-proof storage rooms to protect valuables, vet the adequacy of sprinkler systems, measure driveway entrances and make sure there is a hydrant nearby.</p> \\n<p>Cameron Strothman, a senior risk manager for AIG Private Client Group, said he once had to figure out how to protect a site that was four miles away from the nearest hydrant. He liaised with the local fire department and advised the client to install a 30,000-gallon tank under the driveway so that fire trucks could tap a private water source instead. It cost $35,000.</p> \\n<p>Risk specialists' suggestions generally represent 10 to 15% of total building costs, insurance experts said.</p> \\n<p>Some of the features are things homebuilders would likely install anyway, like a sophisticated fire alarm or sprinkler system, or measures required by building codes. Others cost very little money but can prevent extremely expensive damage. For instance, there is a $100 sensor that shuts off water systems after detecting a leak.</p> \\n<p>Adding these features at the time of construction is also cheaper than doing so once the home is built, risk experts said. A protective storage room for fine art may run less than $100,000 if designed into the plans compared to millions of dollars later, said Steve Bitterman, Vault's chief risk services officer.</p> \\n<p>Gendelman would not disclose the costs associated with building or protecting his home, but said AIG did not charge him for the advice.</p> \\n<p>\\\"Providing this service free is smart for everyone,\\\" he said. \\\"They help me with ideas and they get a loyal client.\\\"</p> \\n<p> </p>\\n<p> (Reporting by Suzanne Barlyn, Editing by Rosalba O'Brien)</p>\",\n",

That brings the total funding to date to more than $100 million.</p>\\n<p>Speaking to&nbsp;<a href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/show/theticker/\\\">Yahoo Finance\\u2019s The Ticker</a>, CEO and Co-Founder Peter Colis said the company would use the fresh funding to expand its team and build on its momentum.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe think of Ethos as what Northwestern Mutual has done for the past 100 years, Ethos is going to do for the next 150 years, protecting generations and generations of families to come,\\u201d Colis said.</p>\\n<p>Founded in 2016, Ethos has utilized artificial intelligence technology to overhaul the life insurance model, built by established players like AIG (<a href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AIG?p=AIG&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch\\\">AIG</a>) and Mass Mutual Financial. Colis says the insurance application process takes on average 15 weeks, in part because of required medical exams and lengthy paperwork.</p>\\n<p>Ethos uses big data and predictive analytics to determine an individual\\u2019s life expectancy and streamline the process. Colis says that allows Ethos to issue insurance on the spot, improving access in the process.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cEthos lets you buy it while you\\u2019re in line at Starbucks. It\\u2019s a 10 minute application and you\\u2019re done,\\u201d Colis said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s an underpenetrated product that should be a household financial product.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Colis says costs associated with the application process have only added to the coverage gap. While 70% of Americans consider life insurance a necessity, 41% have no coverage, according to&nbsp;<a href=\\\"http://theasagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2017-Insurance-Barometer_FINAL.pdf\\\">industry figures</a>.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s a structural issue where you have commissioned sales agents who are incentivized to sell you the largest most expensive policy to the family that can afford that expensive policy. So they\\u2019ll usually try to sell you an investment feature policy that isn\\u2019t necessarily right given your need, your ability to pay,\\u201d Colis said.</p>\\n<p>Ethos\\u2019s coverage is limited to term life insurance right now, which covers individuals for a set time period instead of their entire life. Its revenue has quadrupled since October 2018, according to a company statement.</p>\\n<p>The San Francisco-based firm is one of a handful of startups that are using technology to shake up the insurance space globally. Last year alone, VCs poured more than $3 billion into insurtech companies, according to data compiled by the Fintech Global Database.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/splash/allmarketssummit\\\"> <img src=\\\"https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-08/4bc028c0-c4b5-11e9-8fe7-e809749ffc2e\\\" alt=\\\"Sign up!\\\" credit=\\\"Yahoo Finance\\\" crediturl=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"720\\\" height=\\\"177\\\" data-ops=\\\"\\\"> </img></a></p>\\n<p>-</p>\\n<p><em>Akiko Fujita is an anchor and reporter for Yahoo Finance.

A number of initiatives undertaken by the company to improve profitability in the auto segment have helped it to achieve growth. A strong balance sheet and intelligent capital management are other positives. The acquisition of SquareTrade, PlumChoice and InfoArmor will provide diversification benefits.</p>\\n<p style=\\\"text-align:justify;\\\">The Zacks Ranked #2 (Buy) stock has witnessed 1.2% upward revision in 2019 earnings estimates over the past seven days. The stock carries an impressive Value Score of A. Our research shows that stocks with a Value Style Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1(Strong Buy) or 2 offer the best opportunities in the value investing space.You can see <strong>the complete list of today\\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here</strong><strong>.</strong></p>\\n<p style=\\\"text-align:justify;\\\">Year to date, the stock has gained 24% compared with the industry\\u2019s growth of 3.4%. Other players in the same industry such as American International Group, Inc. AIG, The Progressive Corp. PGR and Chubb Limited CB have gained 32%, 26% and 21%, respectively.</p>\\n<p style=\\\"text-align:justify;\\\"><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/F2Hy9u7pnfcedf.nqMZ_4Q--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247cT03NTs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/zacks.com/025e21e8c5dbf24012cded2379768639\\\" style=\\\"width:620px;height:214px;\\\" /></p>\\n<p style=\\\"text-align:justify;\\\"><strong>Factors That Make the Stock Look Attractive</strong></p>\\n<p style=\\\"text-align:justify;\\\"><strong>Property-Liability Business Performing Strongly:</strong> The company's property and liability business continues to be profitable owing to pricing discipline and strong claims management. It is also benefiting from past acquisitions and growth in the emerging businesses as reflected by consistent increase in earned written over the years. The trend continued in the first six months of 2019, reflecting a 6% increase in net written. We expect the segment to continue adding to its top line, given a number of strategic initiatives undertaken for growth, such as product enhancements and changes in business mix to focus on those that command a high return on equity.<br><br>Also, its combined ratio, which measures the profitability of an insurance company, (the lower the better) has improved to 93.6% in 2019 from 96% in 2018. This reflects the company\\u2019s control on its claims cost as well as other expenses. Though Allstate is exposed to catastrophic losses, it has covered itself well by the use of reinsurance to&nbsp; deal with these losses.</br></br></p>\\n<p style=\\\"text-align:justify;\\\"><strong>Growing Service Business:&nbsp; </strong>The company is making concerted efforts to expand its Service business, which provides diversification benefits. In this vein, it acquired SquareTrade in 2017, a provider of protection plans for mobile phones, consumer electronics and appliances. Allstate also acquired PlumChoice in 2018, a leading provider of cloud and technical support services to consumers and small businesses. In February 2019, iCracked was acquired in this segment,&nbsp; These buyouts will expand its Service business, which grew premiums by 6.5% in the first half of 2019.<br>Decline in Leverage: The company\\u2019s debt-to-equity ratio has moderated to 27% from 30% in 2013. Times interest earned of Allstate, a ratio that measures a company\\u2019s ability to pay its interest expenses is 11, better than the industry average of 10.7. A decline in leverage strengthens the company\\u2019s balance sheet and reduces financial risk.</br></p>\\n<p style=\\\"text-align:justify;\\\"><strong>Strong Balance Sheet and Efficient Capital Management:</strong> The company\\u2019s cash flow has been increasing over the years. Management\\u2019s proactive risk mitigation and return optimization programs continue to enhance operating cash flow and shareholder value. Its disciplined capital management by way of share buyback and dividend hike is also impressive.&nbsp; In February, Allstate increased its quarterly dividend by 24%. Its current dividend yield of 2.2% is considerably higher than 0.53% of the industry. We believe, the company\\u2019s financial strength will continue to inspire investors\\u2019 confidence in the stock.</p>\\n<p style=\\\"text-align:justify;\\\"><strong>Strong ROE: </strong>Allstate\\u2019s trailing 12-month return on equity (ROE) reinforces its growth potential. The company\\u2019s ROE of 13% has improved over the past two years and remains way higher than the industry\\u2019s 6.8% ROE, reflecting its tactical efficiency in using its shareholders\\u2019 funds.</p>\\n<p style=\\\"text-align:justify;\\\"><strong>The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All</strong><br><br>Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce \\\"the world's first trillionaires,\\\" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.<br><br><strong>See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend &gt;&gt;</strong></br></br></br></br></p>\\n<br>Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Prices were bouncing off of a \\\"neckline\\\" around $242 but that tentative support has given way and RE is testing the rising 200-day moving average line.  The On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line made its high in May and its subsequent decline the past four months tells me that sellers have been more aggressive.\",\n",

Its performance aroused scepticism over its ability to turn around the underperforming business.</p>\\n<p style=\\\"text-align:justify;\\\">This pessimism also led to a 34% decline in the company\\u2019s share price in 2018 and 8.8% fall in 2017. However, in 2019, the stock has gained 33% year to date compared with its industry\\u2019s rise of 0.5%.</p>\\n<p style=\\\"text-align:justify;\\\"><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"https://s1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/LWEsQ1Ix9VAy7YMkYWGF2A--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247cT03NTs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/zacks.com/0e16263f7828daa4349c7550ee5a5490\\\" /></p>\\n<p style=\\\"text-align:justify;\\\">Since the beginning of 2018, American International has been focusing on addressing several critical areas, such as refining its approach to underwriting, reducing risk profile, overhauling reinsurance strategy to reduce volatility, making General Insurance business profitable and remediating challenged legacy businesses, and position itself strategically in the global insurance marketplace.</p>\\n<p style=\\\"text-align:justify;\\\">The company has achieved quite a bit in its largest segment, General Insurance (contributing nearly 67% of total revenues in 2018), by posting an underwriting profit and a favorable combined ratio in the first half of 2019. This underwriting profit represents a significant milestone for AIG, and reflects the tremendous work taken up by management to improve underwriting fundamentals.</p>\\n<p style=\\\"text-align:justify;\\\">The company\\u2019s approach to reinsurance, which has dramatically reduced risk and volatility, onboard acquisitions and continuous expense discipline across General Insurance, is expected to drive the segment\\u2019s results. Management remains confident that the segment will continue to improve its financial performance and deliver underwriting profit for full-year 2019.</p>\\n<p style=\\\"text-align:justify;\\\">Along with growing its top line, the company has tightened its grip on expenses, which has aided its margins. It has also witnessed a decline in expense ratio, despite making investments in talent, business process and infrastructure to support its long-term profitable growth objectives.</p>\\n<p style=\\\"text-align:justify;\\\">AIG\\u2019s continuous focus on strengthening its underwriting fundamentals, the changing mix of business and the focus on inorganic growth should pay off. Recently the company completed the buyout of Validus and Glatfelter. Validus adds an attractive bundle of businesses, including a reinsurance platform (Validus Re), an insurance-linked securities asset manager (AlphaCat), a Lloyd\\u2019s syndicate (Talbot), a specialty US small commercial excess and surplus underwriting team (Western World), and Crop Risk services, which focuses on the North American crop insurance market.</p>\\n<p style=\\\"text-align:justify;\\\">The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).&nbsp; Some better-ranked stocks worth considering are James River Group Holdings, Ltd. JRVR, Assurant Inc. AIZ and Radian Group, Inc. RDN. While James River Group sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Assurant and Radian Group carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).<br><br>James River beat estimates in three of the four reported quarters with an average positive surprise of 2.62%. Assurant and Radian beat estimates in each of the four reported quarters with an average positive surprise of 21.75% and 10.10%, respectively.</br></br></p>\\n<p>You can see <strong>the complete list of today\\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here</strong><strong>.</strong></p>\\n<p style=\\\"text-align:justify;\\\"><br><strong>Today's Best Stocks from Zacks</strong><br><br>Would you like to see the updated picks from our best market-beating strategies?

But forest fires that have torched nearby land in recent years left him concerned.</p> \\n<p>So Gendelman, who runs an insurance brokerage, tapped into a program that American International Group Inc offers to help design luxury properties in ways that mitigate disaster risk. A risk specialist made sure his home had a lightning-repellant system, cisterns to hold water run-off and ceramic shingles that look like wood. Just in case a blaze does break out, his driveway was designed to accommodate a fire truck's maneuvers.</p> \\n<p>\\\"It's a very high-end home and we're dealing with very good contractors,\\\" Gendelman said. \\\"But (the AIG program) brought them systems they never used and resources they never heard of.\\\"</p> \\n<p>Fires, floods, hurricanes and other catastrophes have cost https://tmsnrt.rs/2Zq5hUs U.S. insurers more than $170 billion in property losses since 2016, according to Property Claim Services (PCS), part of Verisk Analytics Inc, and the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis.</p> \\n<p>Few actuaries expect the trend to ease as climate change accelerates, and the swell of claims has prompted some insurers to get involved in the design process for lavish residential properties.</p> \\n<p>Insurers and industry groups said they do not track data on the service, which is still a tiny part of the property-casualty insurance industry. But executives, real-estate developers and brokers, builders and analysts who spoke to Reuters said they believe it will only expand.</p> \\n<p>\\\"People don't naturally think of insurance as the first place to go,\\\" said Jennifer Naughton, head of North American personal insurance risk consulting services at Chubb Ltd. \\\"But an insurance company can give you an advantage of the loss potential and might save you the pain of loss in the future.\\\"</p> \\n<p>Chubb's risk managers make sure homeowners who request the service have water storage on the property to supplement the local fire department's resources, and recommend devices that allow emergency workers to open electronic entry gates, among other measures.</p> \\n<p>The trend is not entirely new: PURE Insurance has offered the service since its founding in 2007, and others have quietly made risk specialists available to customers who are designing a home and know to ask for the service. But it is now picking up steam as a stand-alone business at some major property-casualty insurers, as more clients worry about extreme weather.</p> \\n<p>AIG started marketing its service as \\\"Smart Build\\\" in 2015. Initially, only residential construction projects that cost more than $5 million were eligible, but AIG lowered the threshold to $1 million two years later.</p> \\n<p>AIG would not say how many homes it has helped design in total, but a spokesman said there were 20% more projects enrolled during the first six months of 2019 than in the prior-year period.</p> \\n<p>Cincinnati Insurance Companies joined the fray more recently, as did Vault, a high net-worth insurer launched in 2017 by a group of former AIG executives. W.R. Berkley Corp is also looking to offer the service as it ramps up business with wealthy clientele.</p> \\n<p> </p>\\n<p>(GRAPHIC on property losses due to U.S. disasters link: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/INSURERS-DISASTERS/0H001QERS818/index.html)</p> \\n<p> </p>\\n<p>FINE ART PROTECTION</p> \\n<p>The home design process typically begins with an insurance risk specialist scoping out a site to assess possible dangers. For instance, if there is a high water table underground or a nearby body of water, they may suggest elevating the home or choosing another place to build to avoid the risk of flooding.</p> \\n<p>Ken Vona, who heads KVC Builders LLC and frequently teams up with PURE, recalled a couple who decided against a location because the house would have to be raised some 18 feet (5.5 m)off the ground to guard against flood risk. </p> \\n<p>\\\"A perfect example of 'bad piece of property, nice view,'\\\" he said.</p> \\n<p>Once a site is selected, specialists review architectural plans, making sure designs are resistant to water and fire damage, among other risks. They scrutinize plumbing layouts, help design hurricane-proof storage rooms to protect valuables, vet the adequacy of sprinkler systems, measure driveway entrances and make sure there is a hydrant nearby.</p> \\n<p>Cameron Strothman, a senior risk manager for AIG Private Client Group, said he once had to figure out how to protect a site that was four miles away from the nearest hydrant. He liaised with the local fire department and advised the client to install a 30,000-gallon tank under the driveway so that fire trucks could tap a private water source instead. It cost $35,000.</p> \\n<p>Risk specialists' suggestions generally represent 10 to 15% of total building costs, insurance experts said.</p> \\n<p>Some of the features are things homebuilders would likely install anyway, like a sophisticated fire alarm or sprinkler system, or measures required by building codes. Others cost very little money but can prevent extremely expensive damage. For instance, there is a $100 sensor that shuts off water systems after detecting a leak.</p> \\n<p>Adding these features at the time of construction is also cheaper than doing so once the home is built, risk experts said. A protective storage room for fine art may run less than $100,000 if designed into the plans compared to millions of dollars later, said Steve Bitterman, Vault's chief risk services officer.</p> \\n<p>Gendelman would not disclose the costs associated with building or protecting his home, but said AIG did not charge him for the advice.</p> \\n<p>\\\"Providing this service free is smart for everyone,\\\" he said. \\\"They help me with ideas and they get a loyal client.\\\"</p> \\n<p> </p>\\n<p> (Reporting by Suzanne Barlyn, Editing by Rosalba O'Brien)</p>\",\n",

That brings the total funding to date to more than $100 million.</p>\\n<p>Speaking to&nbsp;<a href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/show/theticker/\\\">Yahoo Finance\\u2019s The Ticker</a>, CEO and Co-Founder Peter Colis said the company would use the fresh funding to expand its team and build on its momentum.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe think of Ethos as what Northwestern Mutual has done for the past 100 years, Ethos is going to do for the next 150 years, protecting generations and generations of families to come,\\u201d Colis said.</p>\\n<p>Founded in 2016, Ethos has utilized artificial intelligence technology to overhaul the life insurance model, built by established players like AIG (<a href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AIG?p=AIG&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch\\\">AIG</a>) and Mass Mutual Financial. Colis says the insurance application process takes on average 15 weeks, in part because of required medical exams and lengthy paperwork.</p>\\n<p>Ethos uses big data and predictive analytics to determine an individual\\u2019s life expectancy and streamline the process. Colis says that allows Ethos to issue insurance on the spot, improving access in the process.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cEthos lets you buy it while you\\u2019re in line at Starbucks. It\\u2019s a 10 minute application and you\\u2019re done,\\u201d Colis said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s an underpenetrated product that should be a household financial product.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Colis says costs associated with the application process have only added to the coverage gap. While 70% of Americans consider life insurance a necessity, 41% have no coverage, according to&nbsp;<a href=\\\"http://theasagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2017-Insurance-Barometer_FINAL.pdf\\\">industry figures</a>.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s a structural issue where you have commissioned sales agents who are incentivized to sell you the largest most expensive policy to the family that can afford that expensive policy. So they\\u2019ll usually try to sell you an investment feature policy that isn\\u2019t necessarily right given your need, your ability to pay,\\u201d Colis said.</p>\\n<p>Ethos\\u2019s coverage is limited to term life insurance right now, which covers individuals for a set time period instead of their entire life. Its revenue has quadrupled since October 2018, according to a company statement.</p>\\n<p>The San Francisco-based firm is one of a handful of startups that are using technology to shake up the insurance space globally. Last year alone, VCs poured more than $3 billion into insurtech companies, according to data compiled by the Fintech Global Database.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/splash/allmarketssummit\\\"> <img src=\\\"https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-08/4bc028c0-c4b5-11e9-8fe7-e809749ffc2e\\\" alt=\\\"Sign up!\\\" credit=\\\"Yahoo Finance\\\" crediturl=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"720\\\" height=\\\"177\\\" data-ops=\\\"\\\"> </img></a></p>\\n<p>-</p>\\n<p><em>Akiko Fujita is an anchor and reporter for Yahoo Finance.

A number of initiatives undertaken by the company to improve profitability in the auto segment have helped it to achieve growth. A strong balance sheet and intelligent capital management are other positives. The acquisition of SquareTrade, PlumChoice and InfoArmor will provide diversification benefits.</p>\\n<p style=\\\"text-align:justify;\\\">The Zacks Ranked #2 (Buy) stock has witnessed 1.2% upward revision in 2019 earnings estimates over the past seven days. The stock carries an impressive Value Score of A. Our research shows that stocks with a Value Style Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1(Strong Buy) or 2 offer the best opportunities in the value investing space.You can see <strong>the complete list of today\\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here</strong><strong>.</strong></p>\\n<p style=\\\"text-align:justify;\\\">Year to date, the stock has gained 24% compared with the industry\\u2019s growth of 3.4%. Other players in the same industry such as American International Group, Inc. AIG, The Progressive Corp. PGR and Chubb Limited CB have gained 32%, 26% and 21%, respectively.</p>\\n<p style=\\\"text-align:justify;\\\"><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/F2Hy9u7pnfcedf.nqMZ_4Q--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247cT03NTs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/zacks.com/025e21e8c5dbf24012cded2379768639\\\" style=\\\"width:620px;height:214px;\\\" /></p>\\n<p style=\\\"text-align:justify;\\\"><strong>Factors That Make the Stock Look Attractive</strong></p>\\n<p style=\\\"text-align:justify;\\\"><strong>Property-Liability Business Performing Strongly:</strong> The company's property and liability business continues to be profitable owing to pricing discipline and strong claims management. It is also benefiting from past acquisitions and growth in the emerging businesses as reflected by consistent increase in earned written over the years. The trend continued in the first six months of 2019, reflecting a 6% increase in net written. We expect the segment to continue adding to its top line, given a number of strategic initiatives undertaken for growth, such as product enhancements and changes in business mix to focus on those that command a high return on equity.<br><br>Also, its combined ratio, which measures the profitability of an insurance company, (the lower the better) has improved to 93.6% in 2019 from 96% in 2018. This reflects the company\\u2019s control on its claims cost as well as other expenses. Though Allstate is exposed to catastrophic losses, it has covered itself well by the use of reinsurance to&nbsp; deal with these losses.</br></br></p>\\n<p style=\\\"text-align:justify;\\\"><strong>Growing Service Business:&nbsp; </strong>The company is making concerted efforts to expand its Service business, which provides diversification benefits. In this vein, it acquired SquareTrade in 2017, a provider of protection plans for mobile phones, consumer electronics and appliances. Allstate also acquired PlumChoice in 2018, a leading provider of cloud and technical support services to consumers and small businesses. In February 2019, iCracked was acquired in this segment,&nbsp; These buyouts will expand its Service business, which grew premiums by 6.5% in the first half of 2019.<br>Decline in Leverage: The company\\u2019s debt-to-equity ratio has moderated to 27% from 30% in 2013. Times interest earned of Allstate, a ratio that measures a company\\u2019s ability to pay its interest expenses is 11, better than the industry average of 10.7. A decline in leverage strengthens the company\\u2019s balance sheet and reduces financial risk.</br></p>\\n<p style=\\\"text-align:justify;\\\"><strong>Strong Balance Sheet and Efficient Capital Management:</strong> The company\\u2019s cash flow has been increasing over the years. Management\\u2019s proactive risk mitigation and return optimization programs continue to enhance operating cash flow and shareholder value. Its disciplined capital management by way of share buyback and dividend hike is also impressive.&nbsp; In February, Allstate increased its quarterly dividend by 24%. Its current dividend yield of 2.2% is considerably higher than 0.53% of the industry. We believe, the company\\u2019s financial strength will continue to inspire investors\\u2019 confidence in the stock.</p>\\n<p style=\\\"text-align:justify;\\\"><strong>Strong ROE: </strong>Allstate\\u2019s trailing 12-month return on equity (ROE) reinforces its growth potential. The company\\u2019s ROE of 13% has improved over the past two years and remains way higher than the industry\\u2019s 6.8% ROE, reflecting its tactical efficiency in using its shareholders\\u2019 funds.</p>\\n<p style=\\\"text-align:justify;\\\"><strong>The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All</strong><br><br>Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce \\\"the world's first trillionaires,\\\" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.<br><br><strong>See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend &gt;&gt;</strong></br></br></br></br></p>\\n<br>Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line made its high in May and its subsequent decline the past four months tells me that sellers have been more aggressive.\",\n",

Its performance aroused scepticism over its ability to turn around the underperforming business.</p>\\n<p style=\\\"text-align:justify;\\\">This pessimism also led to a 34% decline in the company\\u2019s share price in 2018 and 8.8% fall in 2017. However, in 2019, the stock has gained 33% year to date compared with its industry\\u2019s rise of 0.5%.</p>\\n<p style=\\\"text-align:justify;\\\"><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"https://s1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/LWEsQ1Ix9VAy7YMkYWGF2A--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247cT03NTs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/zacks.com/0e16263f7828daa4349c7550ee5a5490\\\" /></p>\\n<p style=\\\"text-align:justify;\\\">Since the beginning of 2018, American International has been focusing on addressing several critical areas, such as refining its approach to underwriting, reducing risk profile, overhauling reinsurance strategy to reduce volatility, making General Insurance business profitable and remediating challenged legacy businesses, and position itself strategically in the global insurance marketplace.</p>\\n<p style=\\\"text-align:justify;\\\">The company has achieved quite a bit in its largest segment, General Insurance (contributing nearly 67% of total revenues in 2018), by posting an underwriting profit and a favorable combined ratio in the first half of 2019. This underwriting profit represents a significant milestone for AIG, and reflects the tremendous work taken up by management to improve underwriting fundamentals.</p>\\n<p style=\\\"text-align:justify;\\\">The company\\u2019s approach to reinsurance, which has dramatically reduced risk and volatility, onboard acquisitions and continuous expense discipline across General Insurance, is expected to drive the segment\\u2019s results. Management remains confident that the segment will continue to improve its financial performance and deliver underwriting profit for full-year 2019.</p>\\n<p style=\\\"text-align:justify;\\\">Along with growing its top line, the company has tightened its grip on expenses, which has aided its margins. It has also witnessed a decline in expense ratio, despite making investments in talent, business process and infrastructure to support its long-term profitable growth objectives.</p>\\n<p style=\\\"text-align:justify;\\\">AIG\\u2019s continuous focus on strengthening its underwriting fundamentals, the changing mix of business and the focus on inorganic growth should pay off. Recently the company completed the buyout of Validus and Glatfelter. Validus adds an attractive bundle of businesses, including a reinsurance platform (Validus Re), an insurance-linked securities asset manager (AlphaCat), a Lloyd\\u2019s syndicate (Talbot), a specialty US small commercial excess and surplus underwriting team (Western World), and Crop Risk services, which focuses on the North American crop insurance market.</p>\\n<p style=\\\"text-align:justify;\\\">The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).&nbsp; Some better-ranked stocks worth considering are James River Group Holdings, Ltd. JRVR, Assurant Inc. AIZ and Radian Group, Inc. RDN. While James River Group sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Assurant and Radian Group carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).<br><br>James River beat estimates in three of the four reported quarters with an average positive surprise of 2.62%.

      "                    \"content\": \"<p>By Suzanne Barlyn</p> \\n<p>NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bruce Gendelman wanted a mountainside retreat when he bought 12 acres in Aspen, Colorado. But forest fires that have torched nearby land in recent years left him concerned.</p> \\n<p>So Gendelman, who runs an insurance brokerage, tapped into a program that American International Group Inc offers to help design luxury properties in ways that mitigate disaster risk. A risk specialist made sure his home had a lightning-repellant system, cisterns to hold water run-off and ceramic shingles that look like wood. Just in case a blaze does break out, his driveway was designed to accommodate a fire truck's maneuvers.</p> \\n<p>\\\"It's a very high-end home and we're dealing with very good contractors,\\\" Gendelman said. \\\"But (the AIG program) brought them systems they never used and resources they never heard of.\\\"</p> \\n<p>Fires, floods, hurricanes and other catastrophes have cost https://tmsnrt.rs/2Zq5hUs U.S. insurers more than $170 billion in property losses since 2016, according to Property Claim Services (PCS), part of Verisk Analytics Inc, and the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis.</p> \\n<p>Few actuaries expect the trend to ease as climate change accelerates, and the swell of claims has prompted some insurers to get involved in the design process for lavish residential properties.</p> \\n<p>Insurers and industry groups said they do not track data on the service, which is still a tiny part of the property-casualty insurance industry. But executives, real-estate developers and brokers, builders and analysts who spoke to Reuters said they believe it will only expand.</p> \\n<p>\\\"People don't naturally think of insurance as the first place to go,\\\" said Jennifer Naughton, head of North American personal insurance risk consulting services at Chubb Ltd. \\\"But an insurance company can give you an advantage of the loss potential and might save you the pain of loss in the future.\\\"</p> \\n<p>Chubb's risk managers make sure homeowners who request the service have water storage on the property to supplement the local fire department's resources, and recommend devices that allow emergency workers to open electronic entry gates, among other measures.</p> \\n<p>The trend is not entirely new: PURE Insurance has offered the service since its founding in 2007, and others have quietly made risk specialists available to customers who are designing a home and know to ask for the service. But it is now picking up steam as a stand-alone business at some major property-casualty insurers, as more clients worry about extreme weather.</p> \\n<p>AIG started marketing its service as \\\"Smart Build\\\" in 2015. Initially, only residential construction projects that cost more than $5 million were eligible, but AIG lowered the threshold to $1 million two years later.</p> \\n<p>AIG would not say how many homes it has helped design in total, but a spokesman said there were 20% more projects enrolled during the first six months of 2019 than in the prior-year period.</p> \\n<p>Cincinnati Insurance Companies joined the fray more recently, as did Vault, a high net-worth insurer launched in 2017 by a group of former AIG executives. W.R. Berkley Corp is also looking to offer the service as it ramps up business with wealthy clientele.</p> \\n<p> </p>\\n<p>(GRAPHIC on property losses due to U.S. disasters link: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/INSURERS-DISASTERS/0H001QERS818/index.html)</p> \\n<p> </p>\\n<p>FINE ART PROTECTION</p> \\n<p>The home design process typically begins with an insurance risk specialist scoping out a site to assess possible dangers. For instance, if there is a high water table underground or a nearby body of water, they may suggest elevating the home or choosing another place to build to avoid the risk of flooding.</p> \\n<p>Ken Vona, who heads KVC Builders LLC and frequently teams up with PURE, recalled a couple who decided against a location because the house would have to be raised some 18 feet (5.5 m)off the ground to guard against flood risk. </p> \\n<p>\\\"A perfect example of 'bad piece of property, nice view,'\\\" he said.</p> \\n<p>Once a site is selected, specialists review architectural plans, making sure designs are resistant to water and fire damage, among other risks. They scrutinize plumbing layouts, help design hurricane-proof storage rooms to protect valuables, vet the adequacy of sprinkler systems, measure driveway entrances and make sure there is a hydrant nearby.</p> \\n<p>Cameron Strothman, a senior risk manager for AIG Private Client Group, said he once had to figure out how to protect a site that was four miles away from the nearest hydrant. He liaised with the local fire department and advised the client to install a 30,000-gallon tank under the driveway so that fire trucks could tap a private water source instead. It cost $35,000.</p> \\n<p>Risk specialists' suggestions generally represent 10 to 15% of total building costs, insurance experts said.</p> \\n<p>Some of the features are things homebuilders would likely install anyway, like a sophisticated fire alarm or sprinkler system, or measures required by building codes. Others cost very little money but can prevent extremely expensive damage. For instance, there is a $100 sensor that shuts off water systems after detecting a leak.</p> \\n<p>Adding these features at the time of construction is also cheaper than doing so once the home is built, risk experts said. A protective storage room for fine art may run less than $100,000 if designed into the plans compared to millions of dollars later, said Steve Bitterman, Vault's chief risk services officer.</p> \\n<p>Gendelman would not disclose the costs associated with building or protecting his home, but said AIG did not charge him for the advice.</p> \\n<p>\\\"Providing this service free is smart for everyone,\\\" he said. \\\"They help me with ideas and they get a loyal client.\\\"</p> \\n<p> </p>\\n<p> (Reporting by Suzanne Barlyn, Editing by Rosalba O'Brien)</p>\",\n",

That brings the total funding to date to more than $100 million.</p>\\n<p>Speaking to&nbsp;<a href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/show/theticker/\\\">Yahoo Finance\\u2019s The Ticker</a>, CEO and Co-Founder Peter Colis said the company would use the fresh funding to expand its team and build on its momentum.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe think of Ethos as what Northwestern Mutual has done for the past 100 years, Ethos is going to do for the next 150 years, protecting generations and generations of families to come,\\u201d Colis said.</p>\\n<p>Founded in 2016, Ethos has utilized artificial intelligence technology to overhaul the life insurance model, built by established players like AIG (<a href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AIG?p=AIG&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch\\\">AIG</a>) and Mass Mutual Financial. Colis says the insurance application process takes on average 15 weeks, in part because of required medical exams and lengthy paperwork.</p>\\n<p>Ethos uses big data and predictive analytics to determine an individual\\u2019s life expectancy and streamline the process. Colis says that allows Ethos to issue insurance on the spot, improving access in the process.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cEthos lets you buy it while you\\u2019re in line at Starbucks. It\\u2019s a 10 minute application and you\\u2019re done,\\u201d Colis said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s an underpenetrated product that should be a household financial product.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Colis says costs associated with the application process have only added to the coverage gap. While 70% of Americans consider life insurance a necessity, 41% have no coverage, according to&nbsp;<a href=\\\"http://theasagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2017-Insurance-Barometer_FINAL.pdf\\\">industry figures</a>.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s a structural issue where you have commissioned sales agents who are incentivized to sell you the largest most expensive policy to the family that can afford that expensive policy.

PGR and Chubb Limited CB have gained 32%, 26% and 21%, respectively.</p>\\n<p style=\\\"text-align:justify;\\\"><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/F2Hy9u7pnfcedf.nqMZ_4Q--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247cT03NTs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/zacks.com/025e21e8c5dbf24012cded2379768639\\\" style=\\\"width:620px;height:214px;\\\" /></p>\\n<p style=\\\"text-align:justify;\\\"><strong>Factors That Make the Stock Look Attractive</strong></p>\\n<p style=\\\"text-align:justify;\\\"><strong>Property-Liability Business Performing Strongly:</strong> The company's property and liability business continues to be profitable owing to pricing discipline and strong claims management. It is also benefiting from past acquisitions and growth in the emerging businesses as reflected by consistent increase in earned written over the years. The trend continued in the first six months of 2019, reflecting a 6% increase in net written. We expect the segment to continue adding to its top line, given a number of strategic initiatives undertaken for growth, such as product enhancements and changes in business mix to focus on those that command a high return on equity.<br><br>Also, its combined ratio, which measures the profitability of an insurance company, (the lower the better) has improved to 93.6% in 2019 from 96% in 2018. This reflects the company\\u2019s control on its claims cost as well as other expenses. Though Allstate is exposed to catastrophic losses, it has covered itself well by the use of reinsurance to&nbsp; deal with these losses.</br></br></p>\\n<p style=\\\"text-align:justify;\\\"><strong>Growing Service Business:&nbsp; </strong>The company is making concerted efforts to expand its Service business, which provides diversification benefits. In this vein, it acquired SquareTrade in 2017, a provider of protection plans for mobile phones, consumer electronics and appliances. Allstate also acquired PlumChoice in 2018, a leading provider of cloud and technical support services to consumers and small businesses. In February 2019, iCracked was acquired in this segment,&nbsp; These buyouts will expand its Service business, which grew premiums by 6.5% in the first half of 2019.<br>Decline in Leverage: The company\\u2019s debt-to-equity ratio has moderated to 27% from 30% in 2013. Times interest earned of Allstate, a ratio that measures a company\\u2019s ability to pay its interest expenses is 11, better than the industry average of 10.7. A decline in leverage strengthens the company\\u2019s balance sheet and reduces financial risk.</br></p>\\n<p style=\\\"text-align:justify;\\\"><strong>Strong Balance Sheet and Efficient Capital Management:</strong> The company\\u2019s cash flow has been increasing over the years. Management\\u2019s proactive risk mitigation and return optimization programs continue to enhance operating cash flow and shareholder value. Its disciplined capital management by way of share buyback and dividend hike is also impressive.&nbsp; In February, Allstate increased its quarterly dividend by 24%. Its current dividend yield of 2.2% is considerably higher than 0.53% of the industry. We believe, the company\\u2019s financial strength will continue to inspire investors\\u2019 confidence in the stock.</p>\\n<p style=\\\"text-align:justify;\\\"><strong>Strong ROE: </strong>Allstate\\u2019s trailing 12-month return on equity (ROE) reinforces its growth potential. The company\\u2019s ROE of 13% has improved over the past two years and remains way higher than the industry\\u2019s 6.8% ROE, reflecting its tactical efficiency in using its shareholders\\u2019 funds.</p>\\n<p style=\\\"text-align:justify;\\\"><strong>The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All</strong><br><br>Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce \\\"the world's first trillionaires,\\\" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.<br><br><strong>See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend &gt;&gt;</strong></br></br></br></br></p>\\n<br>Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

In this daily bar chart of RE, below, we can see that prices have rolled over since early May. Prices were bouncing off of a \\\"neckline\\\" around $242 but that tentative support has given way and RE is testing the rising 200-day moving average line.  The On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line made its high in May and its subsequent decline the past four months tells me that sellers have been more aggressive.\",\n",

Its performance aroused scepticism over its ability to turn around the underperforming business.</p>\\n<p style=\\\"text-align:justify;\\\">This pessimism also led to a 34% decline in the company\\u2019s share price in 2018 and 8.8% fall in 2017. However, in 2019, the stock has gained 33% year to date compared with its industry\\u2019s rise of 0.5%.</p>\\n<p style=\\\"text-align:justify;\\\"><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"https://s1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/LWEsQ1Ix9VAy7YMkYWGF2A--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247cT03NTs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/zacks.com/0e16263f7828daa4349c7550ee5a5490\\\" /></p>\\n<p style=\\\"text-align:justify;\\\">Since the beginning of 2018, American International has been focusing on addressing several critical areas, such as refining its approach to underwriting, reducing risk profile, overhauling reinsurance strategy to reduce volatility, making General Insurance business profitable and remediating challenged legacy businesses, and position itself strategically in the global insurance marketplace.</p>\\n<p style=\\\"text-align:justify;\\\">The company has achieved quite a bit in its largest segment, General Insurance (contributing nearly 67% of total revenues in 2018), by posting an underwriting profit and a favorable combined ratio in the first half of 2019. This underwriting profit represents a significant milestone for AIG, and reflects the tremendous work taken up by management to improve underwriting fundamentals.</p>\\n<p style=\\\"text-align:justify;\\\">The company\\u2019s approach to reinsurance, which has dramatically reduced risk and volatility, onboard acquisitions and continuous expense discipline across General Insurance, is expected to drive the segment\\u2019s results. Management remains confident that the segment will continue to improve its financial performance and deliver underwriting profit for full-year 2019.</p>\\n<p style=\\\"text-align:justify;\\\">Along with growing its top line, the company has tightened its grip on expenses, which has aided its margins. It has also witnessed a decline in expense ratio, despite making investments in talent, business process and infrastructure to support its long-term profitable growth objectives.</p>\\n<p style=\\\"text-align:justify;\\\">AIG\\u2019s continuous focus on strengthening its underwriting fundamentals, the changing mix of business and the focus on inorganic growth should pay off. Recently the company completed the buyout of Validus and Glatfelter. Validus adds an attractive bundle of businesses, including a reinsurance platform (Validus Re), an insurance-linked securities asset manager (AlphaCat), a Lloyd\\u2019s syndicate (Talbot), a specialty US small commercial excess and surplus underwriting team (Western World), and Crop Risk services, which focuses on the North American crop insurance market.</p>\\n<p style=\\\"text-align:justify;\\\">The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).&nbsp; Some better-ranked stocks worth considering are James River Group Holdings, Ltd. JRVR, Assurant Inc. AIZ and Radian Group, Inc. RDN. While James River Group sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Assurant and Radian Group carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).<br><br>James River beat estimates in three of the four reported quarters with an average positive surprise of 2.62%. Assurant and Radian beat estimates in each of the four reported quarters with an average positive surprise of 21.75% and 10.10%, respectively.</br></br></p>\\n<p>You can see <strong>the complete list of today\\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here</strong><strong>.</strong></p>\\n<p style=\\\"text-align:justify;\\\"><br><strong>Today's Best Stocks from Zacks</strong><br><br>Would you like to see the updated picks from our best market-beating strategies?

      "                    \"content\": \"<p>By Suzanne Barlyn</p> \\n<p>NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bruce Gendelman wanted a mountainside retreat when he bought 12 acres in Aspen, Colorado. But forest fires that have torched nearby land in recent years left him concerned.</p> \\n<p>So Gendelman, who runs an insurance brokerage, tapped into a program that American International Group Inc offers to help design luxury properties in ways that mitigate disaster risk. A risk specialist made sure his home had a lightning-repellant system, cisterns to hold water run-off and ceramic shingles that look like wood. Just in case a blaze does break out, his driveway was designed to accommodate a fire truck's maneuvers.</p> \\n<p>\\\"It's a very high-end home and we're dealing with very good contractors,\\\" Gendelman said. \\\"But (the AIG program) brought them systems they never used and resources they never heard of.\\\"</p> \\n<p>Fires, floods, hurricanes and other catastrophes have cost https://tmsnrt.rs/2Zq5hUs U.S. insurers more than $170 billion in property losses since 2016, according to Property Claim Services (PCS), part of Verisk Analytics Inc, and the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis.</p> \\n<p>Few actuaries expect the trend to ease as climate change accelerates, and the swell of claims has prompted some insurers to get involved in the design process for lavish residential properties.</p> \\n<p>Insurers and industry groups said they do not track data on the service, which is still a tiny part of the property-casualty insurance industry. But executives, real-estate developers and brokers, builders and analysts who spoke to Reuters said they believe it will only expand.</p> \\n<p>\\\"People don't naturally think of insurance as the first place to go,\\\" said Jennifer Naughton, head of North American personal insurance risk consulting services at Chubb Ltd. \\\"But an insurance company can give you an advantage of the loss potential and might save you the pain of loss in the future.\\\"</p> \\n<p>Chubb's risk managers make sure homeowners who request the service have water storage on the property to supplement the local fire department's resources, and recommend devices that allow emergency workers to open electronic entry gates, among other measures.</p> \\n<p>The trend is not entirely new: PURE Insurance has offered the service since its founding in 2007, and others have quietly made risk specialists available to customers who are designing a home and know to ask for the service. But it is now picking up steam as a stand-alone business at some major property-casualty insurers, as more clients worry about extreme weather.</p> \\n<p>AIG started marketing its service as \\\"Smart Build\\\" in 2015. Initially, only residential construction projects that cost more than $5 million were eligible, but AIG lowered the threshold to $1 million two years later.</p> \\n<p>AIG would not say how many homes it has helped design in total, but a spokesman said there were 20% more projects enrolled during the first six months of 2019 than in the prior-year period.</p> \\n<p>Cincinnati Insurance Companies joined the fray more recently, as did Vault, a high net-worth insurer launched in 2017 by a group of former AIG executives. W.R. Berkley Corp is also looking to offer the service as it ramps up business with wealthy clientele.</p> \\n<p> </p>\\n<p>(GRAPHIC on property losses due to U.S. disasters link: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/INSURERS-DISASTERS/0H001QERS818/index.html)</p> \\n<p> </p>\\n<p>FINE ART PROTECTION</p> \\n<p>The home design process typically begins with an insurance risk specialist scoping out a site to assess possible dangers. For instance, if there is a high water table underground or a nearby body of water, they may suggest elevating the home or choosing another place to build to avoid the risk of flooding.</p> \\n<p>Ken Vona, who heads KVC Builders LLC and frequently teams up with PURE, recalled a couple who decided against a location because the house would have to be raised some 18 feet (5.5 m)off the ground to guard against flood risk. </p> \\n<p>\\\"A perfect example of 'bad piece of property, nice view,'\\\" he said.</p> \\n<p>Once a site is selected, specialists review architectural plans, making sure designs are resistant to water and fire damage, among other risks. They scrutinize plumbing layouts, help design hurricane-proof storage rooms to protect valuables, vet the adequacy of sprinkler systems, measure driveway entrances and make sure there is a hydrant nearby.</p> \\n<p>Cameron Strothman, a senior risk manager for AIG Private Client Group, said he once had to figure out how to protect a site that was four miles away from the nearest hydrant. He liaised with the local fire department and advised the client to install a 30,000-gallon tank under the driveway so that fire trucks could tap a private water source instead. It cost $35,000.</p> \\n<p>Risk specialists' suggestions generally represent 10 to 15% of total building costs, insurance experts said.</p> \\n<p>Some of the features are things homebuilders would likely install anyway, like a sophisticated fire alarm or sprinkler system, or measures required by building codes. Others cost very little money but can prevent extremely expensive damage. For instance, there is a $100 sensor that shuts off water systems after detecting a leak.</p> \\n<p>Adding these features at the time of construction is also cheaper than doing so once the home is built, risk experts said. A protective storage room for fine art may run less than $100,000 if designed into the plans compared to millions of dollars later, said Steve Bitterman, Vault's chief risk services officer.</p> \\n<p>Gendelman would not disclose the costs associated with building or protecting his home, but said AIG did not charge him for the advice.</p> \\n<p>\\\"Providing this service free is smart for everyone,\\\" he said. \\\"They help me with ideas and they get a loyal client.\\\"</p> \\n<p> </p>\\n<p> (Reporting by Suzanne Barlyn, Editing by Rosalba O'Brien)</p>\",\n",

That brings the total funding to date to more than $100 million.</p>\\n<p>Speaking to&nbsp;<a href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/show/theticker/\\\">Yahoo Finance\\u2019s The Ticker</a>, CEO and Co-Founder Peter Colis said the company would use the fresh funding to expand its team and build on its momentum.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe think of Ethos as what Northwestern Mutual has done for the past 100 years, Ethos is going to do for the next 150 years, protecting generations and generations of families to come,\\u201d Colis said.</p>\\n<p>Founded in 2016, Ethos has utilized artificial intelligence technology to overhaul the life insurance model, built by established players like AIG (<a href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AIG?p=AIG&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch\\\">AIG</a>) and Mass Mutual Financial. Colis says the insurance application process takes on average 15 weeks, in part because of required medical exams and lengthy paperwork.</p>\\n<p>Ethos uses big data and predictive analytics to determine an individual\\u2019s life expectancy and streamline the process. Colis says that allows Ethos to issue insurance on the spot, improving access in the process.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cEthos lets you buy it while you\\u2019re in line at Starbucks. It\\u2019s a 10 minute application and you\\u2019re done,\\u201d Colis said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s an underpenetrated product that should be a household financial product.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Colis says costs associated with the application process have only added to the coverage gap. While 70% of Americans consider life insurance a necessity, 41% have no coverage, according to&nbsp;<a href=\\\"http://theasagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2017-Insurance-Barometer_FINAL.pdf\\\">industry figures</a>.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s a structural issue where you have commissioned sales agents who are incentivized to sell you the largest most expensive policy to the family that can afford that expensive policy. So they\\u2019ll usually try to sell you an investment feature policy that isn\\u2019t necessarily right given your need, your ability to pay,\\u201d Colis said.</p>\\n<p>Ethos\\u2019s coverage is limited to term life insurance right now, which covers individuals for a set time period instead of their entire life. Its revenue has quadrupled since October 2018, according to a company statement.</p>\\n<p>The San Francisco-based firm is one of a handful of startups that are using technology to shake up the insurance space globally. Last year alone, VCs poured more than $3 billion into insurtech companies, according to data compiled by the Fintech Global Database.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/splash/allmarketssummit\\\"> <img src=\\\"https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-08/4bc028c0-c4b5-11e9-8fe7-e809749ffc2e\\\" alt=\\\"Sign up!\\\" credit=\\\"Yahoo Finance\\\" crediturl=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"720\\\" height=\\\"177\\\" data-ops=\\\"\\\"> </img></a></p>\\n<p>-</p>\\n<p><em>Akiko Fujita is an anchor and reporter for Yahoo Finance.
